# **How New York’s Subway Ridership Dances to the Rhythm of the City**

"New York City’s subway isn’t just infrastructure - it’s a barometer of the city’s life. Each spike, each dip in ridership tells us something about what’s happening above ground. Whether it’s a marathon, a holiday, or a disaster - the subway responds."

Data Sources:
- Hourly Ridership Data (2020–2024)
- Major Subway Incident Reports (2020–2024)

## **When the City Celebrates** 

### **New York city Marathon**
Every first Sunday in November, over **50,000 runners** flood the streets for the **New York City Marathon**. Stations near Central Park seeing how ridership spikes compared to typical Sundays.

**DATA VISUALIZATION** *A ridership heatmap of Marathon Sunday vs. a regular Sunday, with annotations at key stations.*  

**Our data shows:** INPUT ANALYSIS OF RIDERSHIP
- A **sharp surge** in early morning ridership (5-7 AM) as runners head to Staten Island. 
- A **second wave** (10 AM-2 PM) as spectators travel to cheer zones.  
- A **noticeable dip** in other parts of the city—why? Because half of Manhattan is either running or watching!  

### **New Year’s Eve**  
When the clock strikes midnight in Times Square, the subway faces its biggest crowd surge of the year.

**DATA VISUALIZATION** *A before/after line chart showing NYE ridership vs. recovery the next day.*  

**Our data shows:** INPUT ANALYSIS OF RIDERSHIP
- **42 St-Port Authority** sees **triple its usual ridership** as revellers pour in.  
- **Late-night trains (1-3 AM)** are **50% busier** than an average Saturday.  
- But here’s the twist: **New Year’s Day** sees a **ridership crash**—because half the city is asleep by noon.

## **When the City Struggles**  

### **Incidents During Big Events**
Are celebrations linked to more disruptions?

**DATA VISULIZATION** 
- Incident timelines over Marathon & NYE
- Breakdown by incident type (e.g. crowding, medical, delays)

**Our dara shows:**
- Small spikes in medical/police-related incidents on NYE
- Minimal incidents on Marathon day - Has it gotten better over the years?


### **Weather Extremes vs. Subway Usage**
Snowstorms, heatwaves, and their underground echoes

**DATA VISULIZATION** 
- Scatter plot: temperature vs. ridership
- Annotated extremes (e.g. Jan 2022 snowstorm, July 2023 heatwave)

**Our dara shows:**
- Snow creates a big drop in Bronx/Queens ridership (outer boroughs)?
- Heat creates an increase in subway use (walking becomes unbearable)

### **9/11**

## **System Under Stress**  
Using incident reports as a health monitor for the system

**DATA VISULIZATION** 
- *Monthly line chart of total incidents*  
- *Layered with key public events (e.g. COVID waves, protests, reopenings)*

**Our dara shows:** INPUT ANALYSIS OF Incidents
- Disruption dip in early COVID months (low ridership)
- Rebound in 2021–2022, but incident types shift
- Signals and mechanical issues rise as operations normalize
