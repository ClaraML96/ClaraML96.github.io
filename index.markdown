# **How New York’s Subway Ridership Dances to the Rhythm of the City**
### **A Tale of Events, Incidents, and the Pulse of the Underground**  

New York City’s subway is more than just a transport network - it’s a living, breathing entity that ebbs and flows with the city’s heartbeat. When the ball drops in Times Square on New Year’s Eve, when protestors flood the streets, or when a sudden snowstorm grinds traffic to a halt, the subway tells the story.  

Using **hourly ridership data (2020-2024)** and **major incident reports**, we unravel how events (both planned and unexpected) shape the underground movement of millions. From marathons to meltdowns, here’s how the city’s chaos and celebrations leave their mark on the MTA.

## **The Big Events** 

### **The Marathon Effect**
Every first Sunday in November, over **50,000 runners** flood the streets for the **New York City Marathon**. Stations near Central Park seeing how ridership spikes compared to typical Sundays.

**Our data shows:** INPUT ANALYSIS OF RIDERSHIP
- A **sharp surge** in early morning ridership (5-7 AM) as runners head to Staten Island. 
- A **second wave** (10 AM-2 PM) as spectators travel to cheer zones.  
- A **noticeable dip** in other parts of the city—why? Because half of Manhattan is either running or watching!  

### **New Year’s Eve**  
When the clock strikes midnight in Times Square, the subway faces its biggest crowd surge of the year.
