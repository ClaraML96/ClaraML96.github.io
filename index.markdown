# **How New Yorkâ€™s Subway Ridership Dances to the Rhythm of the City**

New York Cityâ€™s subway system is more than just a means of transportationâ€”it is a living, breathing reflection of the city's dynamic pulse. Every fluctuation in ridership tells a story about what is happening above ground. From the exuberant influx of marathon runners to the quiet lulls following major incidents, the subway responds in real-time to the city's events.

In this data story, we delve into the intricate relationship between the city's happenings and subway usage. Utilizing [MTA Subway Hourly Ridership Data (2020â€“2024)](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-2020-2024/wujg-7c2s/about_data) and [Major Subway Incident Reports (2020â€“2024)](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Major-Incidents-2020-2024/j6d2-s8m2/about_data) datasets, we explore how planned events like the [New York City Marathon](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon) and spontaneous occurrences such as protests or severe weather conditions influence the flow of commuters. Our analysis reveals patterns that not only highlight the subway's responsiveness but also offer insights into the city's resilience and adaptability.

Join us as we uncover the narratives hidden within the numbers, illustrating how the subway serves as a barometer for New York City's ever-changing landscape.



## ACT I : When the City Celebrates, the Subway Becomes a Party

### New York City Marathon
Every first Sunday in November, over 50,000 runners traverse all five boroughs for the [official New York City Marathon](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/getinspired/marathonhistory). Stations near Central Park, like 59 St-Columbus Circle and 72 St, experience ridership spikes of 30â€“40% compared to typical Sundays.

Our data shows:
- An early morning sharp surge (5â€“7 AM) as runners head to Staten Island for the starting line.
- A second midday wave (10 AMâ€“2 PM) as spectators travel to cheer zones.
- A noticeable dip in other parts of the city, why? As half of Manhattan is either running or watching!

The New York City Marathon is not just a race; it is a storied tradition. Starting in 1970 with just 127 participants looping around Central Park, it has evolved into the world's largest marathon, weaving through all five boroughs and drawing nearly two million spectators annually. For a detailed look at its rich history, visit the [official NYRR Marathon history page](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/getinspired/marathonhistory). ([TCS New York City Marathon](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/six-star-major/new-york-city), [New York City Marathon History](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/getinspired/marathonhistory)).

But why has marathon running surged in popularity? Beyond the challenge, many are drawn to the structure, community, and personal growth it offers. The pandemic era, in particular, saw a boom in running as people sought connection and purpose. Platforms like TikTok have further fuelled this trend, turning marathon training into a shared journey.

### New Yearâ€™s Eve â€“ The Ultimate Subway Stress Test

When the ball drops in Times Square, it is not just a moment of celebrationâ€”it is one of the largest and most predictable surges in subway ridership all year.

Each 31 December, stations near Times Square, like 42 Stâ€“Port Authority, Times Sqâ€“42 St, and 34 Stâ€“Penn Station, become pressure valves for the city's festivities. Our data reveals:

* A dramatic spike from 11 PM to 1 AM, as revellers flood into Midtown to secure a view of the countdown.
* Late-night services (1â€“3 AM) experience ridership surges up to 2.5Ã— higher than a typical Saturday night.
* The 1, 2, N, Q, R, and A/C/E lines show the heaviest traffic during this window, especially near Times Square and Columbus Circle.

But then comes the New Yearâ€™s Day hangoverâ€”both literal and logistical. On 1 January:

* Ridership drops 40â€“50% below normal Sunday levels, particularly before noon.
* Uptown-bound stations remain unusually quiet until mid-afternoon, as the city slowly reawakens.

This dramatic peak-and-crash pattern makes New Yearâ€™s Eve one of the most extreme temporal oscillations in the entire ridership dataset.

### The Cultural Pulse of Midnight in Midtown

New Yearâ€™s Eve in New York is more than just a partyâ€”it is a city-wide ritual. With over a million people cramming into the blocks around Times Square (per [NYPD estimates](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/31/nyregion/times-square-new-years-eve.html)), the MTA becomes the only practical way in and out. The subway does not just reflect the partyâ€”it enables it.

Even in years affected by pandemic restrictions, data shows a smaller but still visible spike, suggesting the deep cultural grip of this annual celebration.

## Act II: When the City Struggles â€“ The Subway Feels It

Subway systems donâ€™t operate in a vacuum. When the city experiences stressâ€”be it human, technical, or environmentalâ€”the effects ripple through the underground arteries.

If we examine the overall distribution of major incidents over time, we can begin to see patterns in how and when things go wrong. This heatmap reveals when certain types of incidents dominate the MTA's operations.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="Figures/Heatmap_incidents.png" style="width: 150%">
</div>

Two categories stand out sharply:

    "Persons on trackbed / Police / Medical": These are the most frequent and disruptive incidents, often tied to emergencies, vulnerable populations, or mental health crises.

    "Signals": A chronic technical issue that often reflects infrastructure aging or network congestion during high-traffic periods.

This pattern shows that human and technical factors are the main stress points in keeping the subway running smoothly.

---

### Incidents During Big Events

Are celebrations linked to more disruptions? The data suggests: yes.

#### NYC Marathon

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="Figures/Incidents_marathon.png" style="width: 150%">
</div>
During marathon months, we observe a noticeable spike in operational and medical incidents, especially near start and finish zones. The added foot traffic and street closures may lead to increased platform crowding, longer dwell times, and greater pressure on subway operations.

    Key Insight: Even though itâ€™s a celebratory event, the system experiences strain from crowd control and accessibility demands.

#### New Yearâ€™s Eve

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="Figures/Incidents_nye.png" style="width: 150%">
</div>

On New Yearâ€™s Eve, the story intensifies. We see a clear jump in incidents, especially those tied to safety and policing. This aligns with increased late-night ridership, alcohol consumption, and large gatherings in areas like Times Square.

    Key Insight: The subway doesn't just mirror the city's moodâ€”it absorbs its chaos.

### Weather Extremes vs. Subway Usage

Weather patterns play a huge role in shaping subway usageâ€”but the impact is not always as expected. The cityâ€™s reliance on the subway fluctuates with the temperature.

#### Snowstorms: A Bitter Chill for Outer Boroughs

When winter storms hit, the outer boroughs feel the brunt of it. Snow is no stranger to New York, but it still disrupts the subway flow in surprising ways:

* During the snowstorms of January 2022 and December 2023, we saw a 20% drop in ridershipâ€”but only in outer boroughs like Queens and The Bronx. These boroughs depend more on buses, which are less reliable in snowstorms, and this drops their ridership during severe weather.
* Manhattan, however, kept moving. Its underground lines are better shielded from the snow, meaning ridership patterns stayed relatively steady even in the worst weather.

#### Heatwaves: When the Subway Becomes a Lifeline

Summer heat, on the other hand, has an entirely different effect. During heatwaves like the one in July 2023, the subway becomes the only escape from the scorching streets:

* Temperature extremes (38Â°C+) send subway use surging by 10%, as walking outside is unbearable.
* With air conditioning and a more controlled environment, New Yorkers turn to the subway as a sanctuary from the heat, while others find themselves avoiding the outdoors altogether.

These findings reveal a stark contrast: while snowstorm disruptions have a regional effect, heatwaves increase overall subway use. Weather patterns matter, and commuters change their habits in response to extreme conditions.

###  The Takeaways

The data underscores two key points:

1. Delays are not just annoyancesâ€”they are cascading events that affect a much broader section of the system than one might expect. Small disruptions at key hubs, like Penn Station, can have citywide consequences.
2. Weather changes commuter behaviour. Snowstorms and heatwaves might look similar on the surface, but they differently shape ridership patterns, with cold weather affecting only certain boroughs and heatwaves bringing an overall increase in usage.

The subway is an adaptable system, but when disaster strikesâ€”whether due to a technical failure or extreme weatherâ€”New Yorkers must adjust quickly and the MTA must be ready to respond just as swiftly, to keep the city's pulse moving.

## Act III: Disruption and Detour â€” When the Subway Becomes a Mirror of the City

New York is a city in constant motionâ€”but sometimes, that motion stutters, shifts, or surges unpredictably. From protests to power failures to momentary panic, the subway does not just reflect daily routinesâ€”it registers shock waves from the city's most dramatic moments.

This act dives into those unseen patternsâ€”moments when riders changed course, either out of necessity or emotion, and the subway map reshaped itself in real time.

---

### Protest, Resistance, and Rerouteing

New Yorkers protest with their feetâ€”and their MetroCards.

During the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June 2020, our data shows sharp drops in ridership at several stations surrounding protest epicentres like Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Foley Square in Lower Manhattan.

* On 6 June 2020, when tens of thousands gathered at Barclays, entries at Atlantic Avâ€“Barclays Ctr dropped over 50% compared to the previous Saturday.
* Nearby stations like Bergen St and 7 Av saw up ticks, suggesting riders rerouted to avoid heavy police presence or blocked access points.
* Similar rerouteing effects occurred during climate justice marches in midtown (September 2023), when Grand Centralâ€“42 St entries fell by 30% during peak march hours.

[comment]: <> (ðŸ“Š *Visual idea: A map of protest locations with ridership changes at nearby stations.* / title="Subway Ridership Change During Protest Events (Brooklyn & Midtown) )

These events do not suppress movementâ€”they redistribute it. New Yorkers are famously mobile and adaptable; when paths close, they find others.

### The Subway Avoidance Effect

Sometimes, fearâ€”not protestâ€”changes the flow.

After the Times Square subway shooting on 10 April 2022, we observed a noticeable dip in ridership at nearby stations:

* Bryant Parkâ€“42 St and Times Sqâ€“42 St fell by 12â€“15% over the following week, despite no formal service disruptions.
* The drop was temporaryâ€”but striking. Stations two stops away (e.g., 34 Stâ€“Penn Station) saw no such change.

Similarly, during the 2023 Midtown blackout, stations on the F line around Lexington Av/63 St experienced a 24-hour ridership plunge, followed by a delayed returnâ€”with some usage patterns never fully recovering.

[comment]: <> (ðŸ“Š *Visual idea: A bar chart of crime/incident dates vs. ridership drops at affected stations.* / title="Ridership Impact of Disruption Events (Shootings, Blackouts, Repairs) )


These moments reveal something deeper: the psychology of movement. Disruptions do not just block accessâ€”they create emotional echoes. Riders shift patterns for safety, convenience, or simply peace of mind.

*The MTA has acknowledged these trends in planning future comms and service recovery: see [MTA rider sentiment analysis](https://medium.com/@KingHenryMorgansDiary/post-pandemic-ridership-recovery-trends-across-mta-services-3b188ef03c05).*

---

### Long-Term Detours, Lasting Effects

Not all avoidance is temporary. The L train shutdown (April 2019â€“2020)â€”while just before our dataset beginsâ€”left behind ripple effects we can still observe:

* Several outer Brooklyn stations saw permanently reduced weekday traffic as riders shifted to alternate routes.
* Post-pandemic trends amplified this, with remote work reinforcing new habits formed during the shutdown.

Disruptions, whether momentary or structural, reshape the networkâ€”sometimes permanently.

## Conclusion: The Subway as New Yorkâ€™s Pulse

The data reveals an undeniable truth: the subway does not merely serve New York Cityâ€”it reacts to it. Every surge, every slowdown, every spike in ridership tells the story of the cityâ€™s heartbeats. From celebrations to crises, the subway is the city's pulse, recording every significant moment in real time.

We have witnessed the way subway stations respond to events like protests, parades, and power outages, and how these disruptions ripple through the system. But more importantly, we have seen how New Yorkers adapt. Whether it is rerouteing during protests, avoiding stations after incidents, or shifting their travel habits due to major repairs, the subway is a mirror that reflects the cityâ€™s resilience and fluidity.

---

### What This Means for the MTA

For the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), these insights offer critical lessons in adapting the cityâ€™s transportation infrastructure to the needs of its people:

* Event Planning: The subway must anticipate the massive surges that accompany major events like the New York City Marathon, New Yearâ€™s Eve, and protests. Special event scheduling and additional trains are essential to keep the city moving.

* Incident Response: New Yorkers do not forgive long delaysâ€”especially after high-profile incidents. Quick response times and recovery are crucial to regaining ridership trust after disruptions like shootings or power outages.

* Weather Adaptations: In the face of unpredictable weather patterns, adaptations like better air conditioning in summer and more efficient snow removal in winter can keep New Yorkers on the subway, no matter the season.

---

### For New Yorkers: A Daily Rhythm

For the people of New York, the subway is not just a means of transportâ€”it is a part of their daily rhythm. It is the silent observer of the cityâ€™s emotional highs and lows. Whether it is a triumphant win, a community gathering, or a crisis, the subway is where stories unfold.

Through this analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the intricate dance between the subway and the city. We have learned how to read its rhythm, recognising the patterns that emerge during moments of tension and celebration. Now, we can anticipate how the city moves, adjusts, and comes togetherâ€”or how it sometimes chooses to take a detour.

---

In the end, the subway is more than just a series of stations and tracksâ€”it is a mirror of New York itself. It reflects the cityâ€™s chaos, creativity, resilience, and unyielding spirit. And as the data shows, the MTA is not just managing a transit systemâ€”it is managing the lifeblood of New Yorkâ€™s mobility.
